# Linux-Rootkit-Series forked from Xcellerator

The Linux_kernel_hacking series with the xcellerator was amazing and inspired me to make an updated repo of his project and also make some minor changes since this will be working on 6.11.6. Understanding how these work opens you up to another other world.

This will aim to be a full series of individual malicious linux kernel modules for most recent kernel version 6.11.6.
